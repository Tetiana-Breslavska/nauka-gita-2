                <h2>Jingle Bells</h2>
                <h3>by James Lord Pierpont</h3>
                <p>
                    Dashing through the snow,<br>
                    In a one-horse open sleigh,<br>
                    Over the fields we go,<br>
                    Laughing all the way;<br>
                    The bells on bob-tail ring,<br>
                    They make our spirits bright,<br>
                    What fun it is to ride and sing.<br>
                    A sleighing song tonight.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br>
                    Jingle all the way!<br>
                    O what fun it is to ride<br>
                    In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
                    Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br>
                    Jingle all the way!<br>
                    O what fun it is to ride<br>
                    In a one-horse open sleigh.<br>

                </p>

                <p>
                    A day or two ago,<br>
                    I thought I’d take a ride,<br>
                    And soon Miss Fanny Bright<br>
                    Was seated by my side;<br>
                    The horse was lean and lank;<br>
                    Misfortune seemed his lot;<br>
                    He got into a drifted bank,<br>
                    And we, we got upset.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br>
                    Jingle all the way!<br>
                    O what fun it is to ride<br>
                    In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
                    Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br>
                    Jingle all the way!<br>
                    O what fun it is to ride<br>
                    In a one-horse open sleigh.<br>

                </p>

                <p>
                    Now the ground is white<br>
                    So go it while you’re young,<br>
                    Take the girls tonight<br>
                    And sing this sleighing song;<br>
                    Just get a bob-tailed nag<br>
                    Two-forty for his speed<br>
                    Then hitch him to an open sleigh<br>
                    And crack! you’ll take the lead.<br>

                </p>

                <p>
                    Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br>

                    In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
                    Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br>
                    Jingle all the way!<br>
                    O what fun it is to ride<br>
